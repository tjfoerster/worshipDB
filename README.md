## Prerequisites

* You need a Google account with Google Drive enabled.
* You have synchronised your [OpenLP](https://openlp.org/) database `songs.sqlite` (or something like that) with Google Drive.
* You need a server on which you can host worshipDB. Ideally, [CapRover](https://caprover.com/) is set up on it.

## Final remarks

* **Make sure that you and your users have the rights to use the songs. So share your database very carefully!**
* This project has been developed for German-speaking users. There are therefore a few hard-coded German terms because we do not use an internationalization framework for reasons of simplicity. But you can do anything with the code. So change it if you want.
* Let's go and have blessed worship ðŸš€
